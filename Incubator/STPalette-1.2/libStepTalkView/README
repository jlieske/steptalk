What's in this library ?
========================

1) StepTalkObject & StepTalkView

This library contains StepTalkObject, a simple object that hold 
a script (a mere NSString).  When the execute: method is called, it executes 
the script via the StepTalk framework. 

You can define outlets and connect other objects to it.

StepTalkView is a NSButton containing a StepTalkObject. By default its target/action is set
to itself, so when you click on it it will execute the script contained in its StepTalkObject.

2) StepTalkClass

StepTalkClass is an object containing methods and variables; the methods are stored
as StepTalkMethods, and are executed through StepTalk. StepTalkClass instances
can receive normal objective-c messages, and you can thus uses it to build entire
applications in Gorm, using the StepTalkPalette.
