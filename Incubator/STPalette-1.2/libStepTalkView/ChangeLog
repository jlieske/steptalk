26/06/05: v1.2
	- added StepTalkClass, StepTalkMethod, StepTalkRuntime ...

15/06/05: v1.1
	- added a StepTalkObject, similar to StepTalkView but without being a
		view ;-) (and StepTalkView was refactored to use a StepTalkObject)
	- removed the object1,object2,.. object9 outlets -- now you can add
		outlets dynamically and give them any names !
	- StepTalkView now has its target/action set to itself -- so if you
		click on it, it will execute the script.
