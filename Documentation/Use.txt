Possible use of StepTalk
------------------------

StepTalk Shell
--------------
 
    - interactive communication with remote objects

for example i am using it for writing simple tests or for playing with gnustep classes

moreover, the steptalk shell can be used for gnustep-novices to learn about gnustep-classes and their behavior 

or, as i am using it, to communicate interactively with an distant object
