Trouble Shooting
----------------

- Language of a script cannot be recognized.

- It is not possible to see some scripts in the scripts panel.
          
    StepTalk is trying to determine script language by the file extension.
    Each language has a extension list of files which contain scripts in
    that language. To prevend expensive searching for file extensions in
    languages, StepTalk uses a dictionary with file-language mapping. That 
    dictionary is stored in ~/Library/StepTalk/Configuration and is created
    first time you use some StepTalk tool. If you install new language, that
    file has to be updated.
    
    Solution:

    Run in terminal:

        > stupdate_languages
