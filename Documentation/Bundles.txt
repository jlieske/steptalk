Bundles
-------

Any bundle, including an application or a framework, can provide information
about scripting.


Info dictionary
---------------

STClasses                  - array of public classes
STScriptingInfoClass       - name of a scripting controller. Default value is
                             bundleNameScriptingInfo.

(STExportAllClasses         - exports all classes (ignore STClasses))
(not used yet)


Scripting Controller
--------------------

Scripting controller is a class object that provides information about bundle
scripting abilities. At this time it provides information only about available
named objects.

Informal protocol:

+ (NSDictionary *)namedObjectsForScripting;

    Returns a dictionary with named objects.
