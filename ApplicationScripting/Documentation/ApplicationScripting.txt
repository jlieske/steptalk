Application Scripting
---------------------

Creating a scriptable application
---------------------------------

1   Think of objects you want to provide for scripting.

2   Make classes available in ScriptingInfo.plist:

    {
        STClasses = 
        {
            MessageComposition,
            InternetAddress
        };
    }
    
    Add this line to your makefile:
    
        MyApp_RESOURCE_FILES = ScriptingInfo.plist


3 Include bundle loading code

    Copy files from Support directory called
        STScriptingSupport.h 
        STScriptingSupport.m 
    to your project and add following line to your makefile:
    
        MyApp_OBJC_FILES += STScriptingSupport.m

4   Make scripting available to the user

    #import "STScriptingSupport.h"


    ...
        if([NSApp isScriptingSupported])
        {
            [menu addItemWithTitle: @"Scripting"
	                    action: NULL
                     keyEquivalent: @""];

            [menu setSubmenu: [NSApp scriptingMenu]
                     forItem: [menu itemWithTitle:@"Scripting"]];
        }
    ...
