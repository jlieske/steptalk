Gorm Integration
----------------

To make scripting available to the user using gorm, one has to create and
connect menu items activating scripting.

Edit file ClassInformation.plist in Gorm resources by updating FirstResponder
information:

{
    FirstResponder = {
	Actions = (
            /* ... */
            orderFrontScriptsPanel:,
            orderFrontTranscriptWindow:,
            /* ... */
	);

        /* ... */

    };
}

The file is located in $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Applications/Gorm.app/Resources

Note: This is not very nice solution, I know.
