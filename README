What is StepTalk ?
------------------

StepTalk is a scripting framework for creating scriptable servers or
applications. StepTalk, when combined with the dynamism that the Objective-C
language provides, goes way beyond mere scripting.  It is written using
GNUstep.

Sripting environment description
-------------------------------------------

Scripting environment description is used to translate the method names and/or
allow or deny the methods for concrete classes. Denying methods can be used to
create safe scripting  environment as prevention against script viruses.

It contains:
    - list of methods, that are available for scripting for particular class
    - symbolic selector (operator) to selector mapping
    - list of modules to be loaded
    - list of object finders


Standard vs. full scripting
---------------------------
Before each message send, selector is translated using scipting description.
When standard scripting is used and there is no such selector avilable for
scripting for target object, then an exception is raised. With full scripting,
any message should be sent to any target object.
