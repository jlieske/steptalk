TODO list

 1 handle 'connection did die' notification for distant objects in STEnvironment
 2 fix class-info lookup for proxies in STEnvironment
 3 implement NSRect object
 5 Smalltalk: separate compiler and compilation context
 9 create a 'Shell' scripting environment
10 Make loading of frameworks easier in STEnvironment, something like
   loadFrameworkWithName:
11 Create ApplicationScripting framework, instead of bundle. It should offer
   passive application scripting (without linking) and active app. scripting
   (linking with the framewotk). Give it some reasonable name, becauase that one
   is already used by Apple
13 Change source directory structure (see DevelopmentNotes.txt in Doumentation)
